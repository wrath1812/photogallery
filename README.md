This is a React project i made to learn and implement Reactjs and Nodejs.
In this application, users can view, search, and store their images. 
This project uses NodeJs as its backend. We can add pagination to load more images on our user interface.
We are also going to create a NodeJs server that will connect to React front-end through API.
